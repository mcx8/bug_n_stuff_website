    "text": "3/9/2024 (M) I spent a lot of time running after unknown white butterflies (two types – one with a red stripe and another with black spots). Jerks. But thankfully this Empress Leilia let me take it home for our collaborative bug collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3/9/2024 (M) There’s Ethan in the background admiring this rugged butterfly, which I found out from some iNaturalist guy is an “early spring form” of Empress Leilia (Asterocampa leilia). That’s because of the dark margin and pale interior… or so he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/14/2023 (M) Saw this Urbane Digger Bee (Anthophora urbana) happily sipping some breakfast while I was on my way to the library for a meeting. It’s carrying a good stash of pollen too, maybe they’re having a hive party later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/12/2023 (M) Ethan does take very cool bee pictures (actual bee pictured here). This little one (which is the Western Honey Bee, Apis mellifera) is drinking from a fountain. You can’t see it but the fountain is a sculpture of a head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/12/2023 (M) We went to Tohono Chul (Tucson, AZ) and it was a wonderful time :) There were a lot of round-ish cacti (as you can see here) and cute little areas scattered around. Questionably warm outside for October though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9/19/2023 (M) A Queen Butterfly (Danaus gillipus) snacking on some flower outside the University of Arizona Health Sciences Library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9/16/2023 (M) I think Ethan takes very nice pictures so I will include this very cool bee he sent me as well. Maybe it’s a wasp though, who knows. (It really is actually a Yellowjacket though, Vespula or Dolichovespula spp.)"
