Hello and welcome to our collaborative website! Ethan is a math PhD student at the University of Utah, and Maxine is currently a postgraduate researcher at the University of Arizona. One of our favorite things to do together is go on hikes in search of cool bugs. Some of them just get photographed, some of them end up getting captured, but photos of the best ones will always end up here. Maxine is the bug expert and does a great job of identifying everything we come across. Ethan focuses on providing profound and insightful commentary on where and how we acquired each one. Just so you're warned, he is somewhat unreliable when it comes to telling if something is a bee or a wasp. But he makes up for it with his math skills and expansive Wikipedia knowledge. We hope you enjoy our pictures!
