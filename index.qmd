Hello and welcome to our joint website for fun times! Ethan is a Math Ph.D. student at the University of Utah living off of straight up beans, and Maxine is getting her Master's in Statistics at Oregon State University. One of our favorite things to do together is go on hikes in search of cool bugs. Some of them just get photographed, some of them end up getting captured, but photos of the best ones will always end up here.

Maxine is the bug expert and does a great job of identifying everything we come across. Ethan focuses on providing profound and insightful commentary on where and how we acquired each one. Just so you're warned, he is somewhat unreliable when it comes to telling if something is a bee or a wasp. But he makes up for it with his wizard math skills and expansive Wikipedia knowledge. We hope you enjoy our pictures!
