![**4/19/2024 (M)** It was 7:36pm at the Tucson Racquet and Fitness Club when I emptied a small tupperware of mango snacks into my tennis bag for this tiny flying sausage. My boss informed me the next day that it's possibly a *Pontia occidentalis* (the western white) butterfly. He too is now in a box.](images/IMG_14.jpg)

![**3/27/2024 (E)** Not long after returning to Salt Lake City, I found a very sleepy wasp on my doorstep. I seized the opportunity to trap it in a Better Than BouillonÂ® jar (not sponsored (yet)) and it is now chillin' in my freezer. I can't recall what Maxine ID'd it as specifically, but maybe she'll add her own comment here. **(M)** Maxine thinks it's a *Polistes* wasp but she's not 100% sure. There's many wasps wasping out there.](images/IMG_13.jpg)

![**3/9/2024 (E)** For some reason, I'm a really really big fan of little mossy plants growing near creeks and that sort of thing. There's just something very charming about it.](images/IMG_12.jpg)

![**3/9/2024 (E)** Under that plastic deli container is the first addition to our collaborative bug box! It was very interesting watching the capture process. Maxine sat there for probably five minutes waiting for the butterfly to calm down (another Empress Leilia, if I remember correctly) before trying to bag it. It is now in a box.](images/IMG_11.jpg)

![**3/9/2024 (E)** What you can't see out of frame is Maxine's hand creeping up on this poor unsuspecting butterly to capture it. We ended up putting it back because, as you can see here, its wings are a little messed up. Still a cute little guy, though.](images/IMG_10.jpg)

![**3/9/2024 (M)** I spent a lot of time running after unknown white butterflies (two types -- one with a red stripe and another with black spots). Jerks. But thankfully this Empress Leilia let me take it home for our collaborative bug collection.](images/IMG_9.jpg)

![**3/9/2024 (E)** More scenes from Pima Canyon. I think this was probably the greenest hike I've ever done in Tucson.](images/IMG_8.jpg)

![**3/9/2024 (M)** There's Ethan in the background admiring this rugged butterfly, which I found out from some iNaturalist guy is an "early spring form" of Empress Leilia (*Asterocampa leilia*). That's because of the dark margin and pale interior... or so he says.](images/IMG_7.jpg)

![**3/8/2024 (E)** Today was an epic journey, first collecting some breakfast burritos and then ascending Tumamoc Hill to eat them together. Maxine liberated some flowers from the ground on the way back.](images/IMG_6.jpg)

![**3/4/2024 (E)** Pushing the limits of my camera's ability to focus on tiny things to get a shot of these aphids hanging out on a plant.](images/IMG_5.jpg)

![**3/4/2024 (E)** An unsuccessful bug search in the garden on the UofA mall was redeemed by seeing this little guy hanging out in a cactus. I think that's where I'd want to live if I was a tiny lizard.](images/IMG_4.jpg)

![**11/14/2023 (M)** Saw this Urbane Digger Bee (*Anthophora urbana*) happily sipping some breakfast while I was on my way to the library for a meeting. It's carrying a good stash of pollen too, maybe they're having a hive party later.](images/IMG_3pt5.jpg)

![**10/12/2023 (M)** Ethan does take very cool bee pictures (actual bee pictured here). This little one (which is the Western Honey Bee, *Apis mellifera*) is drinking from a fountain. You can't see it but the fountain is a sculpture of a head.](images/IMG_3.jpg)

![**10/12/2023 (M)** We went to Tohono Chul (Tucson, AZ) and it was a wonderful time :) There were a lot of round-ish cacti (as you can see here) and cute little areas scattered around. Questionably warm outside for October though.](images/IMG_2.jpg)

![**9/19/2023 (M)** A Queen Butterfly (*Danaus gillipus*) snacking on some flower outside the University of Arizona Health Sciences Library. Do I know what kind of flower that is? Nope. Maybe one day though.](images/IMG_1pt5.jpg)

![**9/16/2023 (M)** I think Ethan takes very nice pictures so I will include this very cool bee he sent me as well. Maybe it's a wasp though, who knows. (It really is actually a Yellowjacket though, *Vespula* or *Dolichovespula* spp.)](images/IMG_1.jpg)
