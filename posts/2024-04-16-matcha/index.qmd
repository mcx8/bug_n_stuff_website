### about

Honestly I'm just someone who really enjoys a good matcha latte.... especially if it's unsweetened.

### the places i've acquired a drink

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# NECESSARY LIBRARIES ----- 

library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)


# BASE DATAFRAME -----

# Latitude
# Longitude
# Title in pop-up
# Status for which icon to use (which we set to "place" in this case)
# Description in pop-up

travel_list <- 
  
  tribble(~long, ~lat, ~name, ~status, ~trip,
          -77.4169, 39.1459, "Hometown", "home", "Hometown"
          )


# SET CUSTOM ICON BY STATUS -----

# https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/markers.html

awesome_icons <- awesomeIconList(
  "place" = makeAwesomeIcon(icon = "leaf",
                            library = "fa",
                            marker = "olivedrab"))


# MAKE MAP -----

leaflet(data = travel_list, 
        options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 1, maxZoom = NULL)) |>
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") |>
  addAwesomeMarkers(~long, ~lat,
                    label = ~name,
                    popup = ~trip,
                    group = travel_list$trip,
                    icon = ~awesome_icons[status]) |>
  addMiniMap(
    tiles = providers$Esri.WorldImagery,
    toggleDisplay = FALSE
  )
```
