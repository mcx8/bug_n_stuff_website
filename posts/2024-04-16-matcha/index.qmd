### about

I've really enjoyed drinking green teas since I was of some young age, and I remember the first non-matcha tea that I enjoyed was (and what I now know is called) genmaicha. I'm not really sure where my matcha interest started, but I suspect it was either with mochis from Japan or those green tea mochi ice creams from the freezer section of a well-stocked oriental store.

Today, I'd say my favorite tea latte to enjoy is a matcha latte. Particularly the unsweetened ones... which seem to be the "new" trend as of late with these baristas asking if I'm fine with them serving their matchas unsweetened. And I am, of course, though partially because I tend to prefer unsweetened or very lightly sweetened treats anyway.

Nonetheless, here I will keep record of where I've gotten a matcha / matcha latte. Why? Just because it seems like it would be fun to look back on in the future.

### the places i've acquired a drink

# NECESSARY LIBRARIES ----- 

library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)


# BASE DATAFRAME -----

# Latitude
# Longitude
# Title in pop-up
# Status for which icon to use (which we set to "place" in this case)
# Description in pop-up

travel_list <- 
  
  tribble(~long, ~lat, ~name, ~status, ~trip,
          -77.4169, 39.1459, "Hometown", "home", "Hometown"
          )


# SET CUSTOM ICON BY STATUS -----

# https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/markers.html

awesome_icons <- awesomeIconList(
  "place" = makeAwesomeIcon(icon = "leaf",
                            library = "fa",
                            marker = "olivedrab"))


# MAKE MAP -----

leaflet(data = travel_list, 
        options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 1, maxZoom = NULL)) |>
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") |>
  addAwesomeMarkers(~long, ~lat,
                    label = ~name,
                    popup = ~trip,
                    group = travel_list$trip,
                    icon = ~awesome_icons[status]) |>
  addMiniMap(
