### about

I've really enjoyed drinking green teas since I was of some young age, and I remember the first non-matcha tea that I enjoyed was (and what I now know is called) genmaicha. I'm not really sure where my matcha interest started, but I suspect it was either with mochis from Japan or those green tea mochi ice creams from the freezer section of a well-stocked oriental store.

Today, I'd say my favorite tea latte to enjoy is a matcha latte. Particularly the unsweetened ones... which seem to be the "new" trend as of late with these baristas asking if I'm fine with them serving their matchas unsweetened. And I am, of course, though partially because I tend to prefer unsweetened or very lightly sweetened treats anyway.

Nonetheless, here I will keep record of where I've gotten a matcha / matcha latte. Why? Just because it seems like it would be fun to look back on in the future.

![**Chez Peachy (Tucson, AZ) \| 18 May 2024** Got to sip out of a very cute heart-shaped straw which was a 10/10 experience, but I think it was a bit sweet for my taste. Was interesting.](IMG_6419.jpeg)

![**Time Market (Tucson, AZ) \| 7 May 2024** He was browsing the tinned fish selection to pick one for lunch (we got this smoked trout with lemon and juniper and it was exceptional) while I was taking this pic for my records.](IMG_6189.jpeg)

![**Noodleholics (Tucson, AZ) \| 6 May 2024** I misread the menu and this is the sole reason why I have added "matcha" in addition to "matcha latte" to the about section. It was nice, though my illiteracy led me to pay more than I would have liked for some tea water.](IMG_6182.jpeg)
