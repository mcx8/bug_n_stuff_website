### about
I started getting in to baking bread around the same time I started cooking, probably because I really *really* like eating bread.
I mostly do sourdough stuff.

My current starter, named Lev Haroldovich [^†], was born on July 18, 2021, and has served me well since then.
I feed him on a steady diet of Bob's Red Mill Dark Rye Flour (RIP Bob).
Lev lives in the fridge for four days a week in order to keep food costs down, but he has a very happy life.
Below you can see some pictures of my baking attempts!

[^†]: I was reading a lot of Russian literature at the time, and it's an offshoot of my first starter, Harold.
