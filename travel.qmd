### some pics

::: {layout-ncol="3" layout-nrow="3"}
![**5/9/2024 (M)** Look at the spiky plants. Now look at us. Back to the spiky plants. Isn't nature beautiful? We sure think so.](images/travel_section/IMG_5.JPG)

![**3/9/2024 (E)** More scenes from Pima Canyon. I think this was probably the greenest hike I've ever done in Tucson.](images/travel_section/IMG_4.jpg)

![**3/9/2024 (E)** For some reason, I'm a really really big fan of little mossy plants growing near creeks and that sort of thing. There's just something very charming about it. **(M)** I wholeheartedly agree as a moss girl myself.](images/travel_section/IMG_3.jpg)

![**3/8/2024 (E)** Today was an epic journey, first collecting some breakfast burritos and then ascending Tumamoc Hill to eat them together. Maxine liberated some flowers from the ground on the way back.](images/travel_section/IMG_2.jpg)

![**10/12/2023 (M)** We went to Tohono Chul (Tucson, AZ) and it was a wonderful time! There were a lot of round-ish cacti (as you can see here) and cute little areas scattered around. Questionably warm outside for October though. This was Ethan's first visit back to Tucson to see me :)](images/travel_section/IMG_1.jpg)
